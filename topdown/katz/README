MeshSegmenter.java currently contains the slow version of the Katz/Tal algorithm which uses topological distance (i.e. as computed from using Dijkstra's algorithm on the dual graph of the given mesh).

Save MeshSegmenter.java as MeshSegmenter.topo and copy MeshSegmenter.geom to MeshSegmenter.java and compile (javac katz.java) to get this program to run the Katz/Tal algorithm using geometric distance instead of the topological distance described above.  With geometric distance, the algorithm completes in a matter of minutes instead of days.
